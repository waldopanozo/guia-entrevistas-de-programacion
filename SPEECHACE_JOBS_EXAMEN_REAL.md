## Preguntas del Examen

### 1. Do you think job satisfaction is more important than salary when choosing a job? Why or why not?

**Respuesta:**

I believe job satisfaction is more important than salary, though both matter.

When you enjoy your work, you're more motivated, productive, and likely to grow. Salary is important for financial security, but it doesn't sustain motivation if the work isn't engaging.

Job satisfaction often leads to better performance, which can result in career advancement and, ultimately, higher compensation. When you're passionate about what you do, you're willing to invest extra effort, which benefits both personal growth and professional development.

The ideal is finding a balance—a role that offers both reasonable compensation and genuine satisfaction. The key is ensuring the salary meets your needs while the work aligns with your values, interests, and long-term career goals.

### 2. What jobs do you think are most valuable in today's society and why?

**Respuesta:**

I think engineering roles are among the most valuable in today's society because they solve real-world problems and drive innovation.

Engineers design and build the systems and infrastructure that modern life depends on—from communication networks to healthcare systems, transportation, and digital platforms. They translate ideas into solutions that improve efficiency, safety, and quality of life.

What makes engineering particularly valuable is its problem-solving nature. Engineers identify challenges, analyze them systematically, and develop practical solutions. This approach is essential for addressing complex issues like climate change, resource management, and technological advancement.

Additionally, engineering work has a multiplier effect—the solutions engineers create can benefit millions of people. A well-designed system or product can improve productivity, enable new capabilities, and create opportunities across various sectors.

In our increasingly digital and interconnected world, the role of engineers becomes even more critical as they build and maintain the technological foundation that supports almost every aspect of modern society. Their work enables progress and helps bridge the gap between what's possible and what's needed.

### 3. What is your dream job and why?

**Respuesta:**

My dream job is a Principal Engineer or Software Architect where I can design systems and solve complex technical problems while staying hands-on.

I want to influence technology strategy and guide architectural decisions, helping teams build scalable solutions. I also want to mentor other engineers and share knowledge through technical leadership.

Additionally, I'd love to contribute to open-source projects. With the experience I've gained, I believe I could make meaningful contributions—whether it's improving code quality, optimizing performance, or helping design better architectures. Open source allows me to give back to the community while working on interesting problems and collaborating with talented developers worldwide.

What makes this ideal is combining deep technical work with strategic thinking and community contribution. This role would let me continue learning, work on meaningful projects, and have a broader impact while remaining connected to the code and day-to-day technical challenges.
