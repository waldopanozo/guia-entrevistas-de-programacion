[00:00 - 00:02] Well, hello, my name is Murilo.
[00:02 - 00:05] I have over five years of experience working with software engineering.
[00:06 - 00:11] Throughout those years, I had the opportunity to work mainly with Java and JavaScript with
[00:11 - 00:15] amazing companies in which I could actually impact people's lives.
[00:16 - 00:20] And that's actually the one thing that I love the most about technology is that you actually
[00:20 - 00:26] get to see your project impacting people's lives in a real manner in a real life situation.
[00:27 - 00:29] And I also love to mentor new people.
[00:29 - 00:31] This is something that I really like to do.
[00:31 - 00:37] So I'm constantly helping junior developers, intermediate developers to thrive in their professional careers.
[00:38 - 00:39] This is something that I really like to do.
[00:40 - 00:43] And also I love, I'm driven by purpose.
[00:43 - 00:47] So in other companies that I have been through, I could impact people's lives.
[00:47 - 00:50] And that's what I am looking for as a goal.
[00:51 - 00:55] I believe that everyone has a unique characteristic and mine is communication.
[00:55 - 01:04] So I believe that my soft skills helped a lot in my past project by communicating with other areas,
[01:05 - 01:11] helping people to build their recommendations, being always customer-centric and developer-centric.
[01:11 - 01:19] So helping people to understand that software is not only code, but also something to resolve real-life problems.
[01:19 - 01:20] Thank you.
