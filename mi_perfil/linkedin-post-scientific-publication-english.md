# LinkedIn Post - First Scientific Publication (English)

## Option 1: Focused on Technical-Academic Connection (RECOMMENDED)

🎓 A dream come true! 

After much work and dedication, I'm finally able to share that I'm a co-author of my first scientific publication in an internationally indexed journal.

The article "Emerging Technologies in the Banking Sector: Inclusion of Financial Technology (Fintech) and Blockchain in Banking" analyzes how these technologies are transforming the financial sector, improving financial inclusion, reducing costs, and increasing efficiency and security.

As a Senior Software Engineer and PhD student in Business, this achievement represents the perfect union of two passions: technical excellence and rigorous research. The technology I develop day by day now also forms part of the academic knowledge that contributes to science.

Published in ASCE MAGAZINE (Vol. 4, No. 4, 2025) and available in Google Scholar, Crossref, and other academic databases. This milestone marks the beginning of my research career, and although I know it's just the start, it means a lot to me.

Grateful to my co-authors and mentors who accompanied me on this journey. This is just the beginning! 🚀
